# Customer Segmentation Project

## Project Overview
This project applies data science techniques to perform customer segmentation, enabling tailored marketing strategies and improved customer engagement. Using a dataset with transaction histories and demographic information, we created meaningful customer segments to understand varying behaviors and preferences.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**  
   - Gathered and cleaned a comprehensive dataset including transaction histories and demographics.
   - Handled missing values, normalized features, and ensured data consistency.

2. **Feature Selection**  
   - Selected relevant features such as purchase frequency, average spending, and engagement metrics.

3. **Clustering Techniques**  
   - Applied clustering algorithms, including DBSCAN, to segment customers.
   - Defined segments like "Frequent Shoppers" and "High-Risk Borrowers" based on behavioral patterns.

4. **Cluster Analysis & Interpretation**  
   - Analyzed each segment for common traits and purchasing behaviors.
   - Provided actionable insights for targeted marketing strategies.

## Results & Insights
The customer segments identified in this project enable businesses to:
- Enhance customer engagement with personalized marketing.
- Optimize campaigns by targeting specific customer profiles.
- Drive growth by understanding diverse customer needs and preferences.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** for data processing and analysis
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data manipulation
- **Scikit-Learn** for clustering algorithms
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of data-driven customer segmentation in crafting effective marketing strategies, showcasing the impact of data science in understanding customer behavior.
